# Privacy Policy for AntiStrike

**Effective Date: December 24, 2024**

AntiStrike ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

**Physical Activity Data:** The App requires access to your device's physical activity sensors (specifically the Step Detector) to monitor your steps. This data is used solely to provide the core functionality of the App: notifying you when you have moved a target number of steps.

## 2. Data Handling and Storage

**Local Processing Only:** All step counting and activity monitoring happen locally on your device. We do **not** collect, upload, or transmit any of your physical activity data to external servers or third parties.

**Settings Persistence:** Your app configurations (thresholds, time windows, active periods) are stored locally using Android SharedPreferences and are not shared.

## 3. Permissions

To function correctly, the App requests the following permissions:

*   **Activity Recognition:** Required to count steps.
*   **Post Notifications:** Required to send you alerts when movements are detected.

## 4. Data Security

Since all data remains on your device, the security of your data depends on your device's security features.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
